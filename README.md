# ArewaDS Python Programming Fellowship Exercises

Welcome to my practice repository for Python exercises from the ArewaDS Python Programming Fellowship.

Each folder in this repository is organized by topic and contains exercises relevant to its name. For example, the folder `04_Module_Strings` includes exercises specifically related to working with strings.

Feel free to explore and learn with me as I work through these exercises!

Inside 30DaysOfPython create a folder called day_2. Inside this folder create a file named variables.py
Write a python comment saying 'Day 2: 30 Days of python programming'
